    <h1>Full Stach Web DEvelopment</h1>
    <p>Full Stack Web Development refers to the practice of building both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) of a website or web application. A full stack developer works with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface, and also uses back-end languages such as Node.js, Python, or PHP, along with databases like MySQL or MongoDB, to handle server logic, data storage, and application functionality. This all-in-one approach allows developers to build complete, functional web solutions from start to finish.</p>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more, allowing browsers to display websites properly. HTML forms the backbone of all web pages and works together with CSS and JavaScript to build interactive and visually appealing websites.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. While HTML structures the content, CSS is responsible for styling it by setting colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsive designs. CSS allows developers to create visually appealing, well-organized, and consistent websites by separating content from design.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>avaScript is a programming language that enables interactive elements on websites. It allows developers to create dynamic content like animations, form validation, and interactive maps. JavaScript runs in the browser, enabling web pages to respond to user actions in real-time, making websites more engaging and functional. It's a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
